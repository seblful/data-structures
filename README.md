# Data Structures

A learning project where I'm recreating common data structures in C from the ground up to improve my understanding of data structures.

The repository will include implementations of next data structures:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Hash Tables**
- **Trees**
- **Graphs**
- **Heaps**
- **Tries**
