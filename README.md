# Data Structures

A learning project where I'm recreating common data structures in C from the ground up to improve my understanding of data structures.

The repository will include implementations of next data structures:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Hash Tables**
- **Trees**
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree
  - AVL Tree
- **Graphs**
  - Adjacency List
  - Adjacency Matrix
- **Heaps**
  - Min Heap
  - Max Heap
- **Tries**
